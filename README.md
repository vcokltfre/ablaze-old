# Ablaze

A Discord library to ease bot development and improve speed of development.

## Development

Discussion around development happens in the [Ablaze Discord server](https://discord.gg/7dUjwFu2rH), which is where you should go if you wish to contribute to the project.

## Installation

Ablaze is in a very early stage right now, as such the code is not on PyPI, but can still be installed by running:

- Linux/Mac: `pip3 install git+https://github.com/vcokltfre/ablaze`
- Windows: `py -m pip install git+https://github.com/vcokltfre/ablaze`
